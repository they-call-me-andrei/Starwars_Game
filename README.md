**Starwars Game** 

**How it works**   
->2 simple spaceship assets moving with the keyboard arrows and W,A,S,D(this is a 2 player game).   
->eash spaceship fires bullets at a certain rate    
->each player earns points for hitting the other player    

**How I built it**   
-for this application, I used Windows Forms as the UI Framework, and C# as the programming language.
